  description = 'Map all SmartSeq2 Fastq files in a directory.\n\nSteps in the workflow:\n\n  * Look for all `*.fastq.gz` files in the `input_dir` which\n    match the regular expression in `fastq_regex`.\n  * Extract the sample id from the path name using the same `fastq_regex` and `sample_id_replacement`.\n  * Detect cell ids from the path name using the `fastq_regex` and `cell_id_replacement`.\n  * Write the list of samples as a yaml in the output directory.\n  * Map the reads using Cell Ranger\n  * Convert the Cell Ranger output to h5mu\n  * Remove ambient RNA with CellBender\n  * Remove cells with less than 100 genes or 1000 reads.\n  * Make the cell names unique\n  * Output one h5mu file per sample\n\nConcatenating the invididual h5mu files into one h5mu file is a separate pipeline.\n'
