    Map all SmartSeq2 Fastq files in a directory.

    Steps in the workflow:

      * Look for all `*.fastq.gz` files in the `input_dir` which
        match the regular expression in `fastq_regex`.
      * Extract the sample id from the path name using the same `fastq_regex` and `sample_id_replacement`.
      * Detect cell ids from the path name using the `fastq_regex` and `cell_id_replacement`.
      * Write the list of samples as a yaml in the output directory.
      * Map the reads using Cell Ranger
      * Convert the Cell Ranger output to h5mu
      * Remove ambient RNA with CellBender
      * Remove cells with less than 100 genes or 1000 reads.
      * Make the cell names unique
      * Output one h5mu file per sample

    Concatenating the invididual h5mu files into one h5mu file is a separate pipeline.

            For example, if the `fastq_regex` has two groups which are relevant 
            for the constructing the sample ID, the value for this parameter should
            probably be `$1$2`.
